        <h2>Bacon</h2>
        <p>
            Bacon is a type of salt-cured pork made from various cuts, typically from the pork belly or from the less fatty back cuts. It is eaten on its own, as a side dish (particularly in breakfasts), or used as a minor ingredient to flavour dishes (e.g., the club sandwich). Bacon is also used for barding and larding roasts, especially game, including venison and pheasant, and may also be used to insulate or flavour roast joints by being layered onto the meat. The word is derived from the Old High German Bahho, meaning "buttock", "ham" or "side of bacon", and is cognate with the Old French bacon. It may also be distantly cognate with modern German Bauch, meaning "abdomen, belly". <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/foods/carrots">more information...</a>.

        <h2>Carrots</h2>
        <p>
            The carrot (Daucus carota) is a root vegetable often claimed to be the perfect health food.It is crunchy, tasty, and highly nutritious. Carrots are a particularly good source of beta carotene, fiber, vitamin K1, potassium, and antioxidants (1Trusted Source). They’re a weight-loss-friendly food and have been linked to lower cholesterol levels and improved eye health.  What’s more, their carotene antioxidants have been linked to a reduced risk of cancer.  Carrots are found in many colors, including yellow, white, orange, red, and purple. Orange carrots get their bright color from beta carotene, an antioxidant that your body converts into vitamin A.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacon"> more information...</a>

        <h2>Eggs</h2>
        <p>
            Both the white and yolk of an egg are rich in nutrients, including proteins, vitamins and minerals. The yolk also contains cholesterol, fat-soluble vitamins (such as vitamins D and E) and essential fatty acids. Eggs are also an important and versatile ingredient for cooking, as their particular chemical make-up is literally the glue of many important baking reactions.  Since the domestication of the chicken, people have been enjoying and nourishing themselves with eggs. As a long time symbol of fertility and rebirth, the egg has taken its place in religious as well as culinary history. In Christianity, the symbol of the decorated egg has become synonymous with Easter. There are lots of different types of egg available, the most commonly raised are chicken eggs while more gourmet choices include duck, goose and quail eggs.<a href="https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/howto/guide/ingredient-focus-eggs">more information..</a>
