        <h2>About our Food</h2>

        <p >
            Different from the Rest
            If your restaurant provides good food and service but is too similar to other restaurants, customers may overlook your restaurant when deciding where to dine. A good restaurant should have one or more unique features that stand out in a customer’s mind and give it a competitive advantage over others. For example, your restaurant may be the only restaurant in town that makes its ingredients fresh daily or it may have an amazing view of the city that none of your competitors have.
            Good Business Management
            A good restaurant owner manages the business aspect of the restaurant properly, which increases the chances that it can provide quality food and service without interruption. Running your restaurant properly can also help boost your small business’s profits. You must manage your restaurant’s finances, keep good records and stay current with regulatory requirements, such as taxes and health inspections. For example, consistently paying your vendors on time reduces the risk of running out of items on your menu. <a href="https://smallbusiness.chron.com/qualities-characteristics-make-good-restaurant-38863.html">more text...</a>
